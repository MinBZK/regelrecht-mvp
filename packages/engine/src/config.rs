//! Configuration constants for the RegelRecht engine
//!
//! Centralized configuration values used throughout the engine for:
//! - Security limits (prevent DoS attacks)
//! - Resource constraints (memory, CPU)
//! - Recursion depth limits (prevent stack overflow)
//!
//! # Security Considerations
//!
//! These limits are designed to prevent:
//! - YAML bombs (deeply nested or very large documents)
//! - Infinite recursion (circular references)
//! - Memory exhaustion (too many laws or large arrays)
//!
//! # Customization
//!
//! Currently these are compile-time constants. Future versions may
//! support runtime configuration via environment variables or a
//! configuration file.
