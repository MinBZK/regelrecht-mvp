//! Checks on a law document at load time that the schema cannot express.
//!
//! An Unknown (RFC-036) is a fact nobody has, and only resolution produces it:
//! a `source: {}` input without data, an optional parameter the caller left
//! out. Its serialized form `{"__unknown": true, "missing": [...]}` exists so
//! results and traces round-trip, and `Value`'s deserializer therefore builds
//! the variant from any document that carries the sentinel, a law's YAML
//! included. A law that wrote one would put an invented provenance into an
//! outcome, so the loader walks every literal in the definitions and the
//! actions and refuses the document.
//!
//! An article that produces several things (schema v0.8.1) lists them, one
//! item per type, each with its own parameters and outputs. The loader
//! refuses a list with two items of one type, an output given to two items
//! or to none, a parameter or output the article lacks, or a submission that
//! requests a decision this law does not take (RFC-047).
//!
//! A reduction (`regulatory_layer: REDUCTIE`, schema v0.8.2) is no
//! regulation: a cell's reading of its own chronicle (RFC-048), which the
//! cell gives as a named answer. Only a reduction reads the decisions taken
//! under an article (`source.decisions`) or the recorded facts an article
//! requires (`source.facts`); policy and law never do. A reduction does not
//! act on law: it fills no open term (`implements`), hooks onto nothing
//! (`hooks`), replaces no output (`overrides`), takes no decision
//! (`execution.produces`) and delegates nothing (`open_terms`).
//!
//! The engine has no behavior that depends on the schema version a file
//! names: every file runs with the semantics of the latest version. A
//! construct a later version removed is refused with its replacement named:
//! `source.executograms` (v0.8.6), which v0.8.7 replaced by `source.facts`,
//! and `implements` on a reduction (v0.8.5 to v0.8.8), which v0.8.9 replaced
//! by a named answer that a policy binds with `source.reduction`.
//!
//! The policy of the authority that decides binds an open term to an answer
//! (schema v0.8.9, RFC-048): a policy article that fills the term
//! (`implements`) and takes the answer as an input, `source: {reduction:
//! <answer>, parameters: {...}}`. Only such an article takes one, in a
//! policy that names its holder (`competent_authority`), whose cell the
//! engine asks where the term names no competent authorities. The answer
//! stands apart from every other way to a value (`regulation`, `output`,
//! `endpoint`, `decisions`, `facts`, `article`), and only an answer takes a
//! `combine`, which fits the type of the input as on an open term.
//!
//! The loader refuses any of these the other way round, and a `decisions`
//! beside another way to the value.
//!
//! A call to an article (`source.article`, schema v0.8.4, RFC-050) stands
//! apart from `regulation`, `decisions` and `endpoint`, and only such a call
//! takes `parameters_from`.
//!
//! Who may answer an open term, or establish a fact, sits on that term or
//! fact (`competent_authority`, schema v0.8.8, RFC-052); on an article the
//! field keeps its meaning of RFC-002, who decides, and names one authority.
//! The `combine` of an open term makes one value of the answers of several
//! competent answerers. It has to fit the term's type, as the `combine` of a
//! FOREACH has to fit its body: `OR` and `AND` a boolean, `ADD`, `MIN` and
//! `MAX` a number or an amount. `ONLY` is no rule for answers: one answer
//! needs none, and two without a rule are an error already. It sits only on
//! a term that names its competent authorities.
