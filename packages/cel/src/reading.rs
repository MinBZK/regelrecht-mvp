//! The cell reads its chronicle back through its reductions (RFC-048), and
//! gives what they find as named answers.
//!
//! A reduction is rulework of its own kind (`regulatory_layer: REDUCTIE`,
//! the chronolexoreductie of RFC-022 §4.1), in the law format and run by the
//! engine, but no regulation. It sits in the corpus under its holder
//! (`competent_authority`), beside the holder's policy, and it is the only
//! rulework that reads a chronicle. It asks for the decisions taken under an
//! article with `source: {decisions: <regulation>#<article>}`; the cell
//! answers that input with one row per decision in its chronicle ([`rows`]).
//! It asks for the recorded instances of a fact an article requires with
//! `source: {facts: <regulation>#<article>#<fact>}` (schema v0.8.7,
//! RFC-051), one row per executogram ([`executogram_rows`]); the article's
//! `requires` entry for that fact says what each holds. For a norm or a
//! calculation it calls law or policy like any rulework
//! (`source.regulation`), and passes what it found in the chronicle as
//! parameters.
//!
//! A reduction fills no open term. The cell gives its outputs as named
//! answers: its catalogue (`cel.yaml`, `answers`, [`crate::identity`]) names
//! per answer the reduction whose output of that name it is. The policy of
//! the authority that decides binds an open term to an answer
//! (`source.reduction`, RFC-048), and the engine asks the cell for it with
//! the parameters the binding passes ([`Reader`], an [`OpenTermAnswerer`]).
//! The cell runs the reduction itself, on its chronicle, and gives the
//! engine the value with where it comes from: the cell, the answer, the
//! reduction and its article and version, and how far it read the
//! chronicle. The engine does not see the reduction run; the cell explains
//! its answer on request ([`crate::Cell::explain_answer`]). Without the cell,
//! the binding gives nothing, and the term is what it is without one, such
//! as a finding of the deciding authority. So a scenario or another system
//! can supply the same value.
//!
//! Each row carries the decision's `id`, and a field of type `decision`
//! holds the id of the decision it names, as the chronolexogram keeps it.
//! So a reduction can link a decision to another that refers to it, such as
//! a decision on an objection to the decision it contests (RFC-048 §6). A row
//! holds only what its own chronolexogram holds: whether another decision
//! revoked it, a reduction reads from the rows of that other decision.
