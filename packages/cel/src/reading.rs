//! The cell reads its chronicle back through its reductions (RFC-048).
//!
//! A reduction is rulework of its own kind (`regulatory_layer: REDUCTIE`,
//! the chronolexoreductie of RFC-022 §4.1), in the law format and run by the
//! engine, but no regulation. It is kept with the cell
//! (`corpus/cells/<cell>/reducties/<id>/<valid_from>.yaml`) and only the cell
//! loads it. It asks for the decisions taken under an article with
//! `source: {decisions: <regulation>#<article>}`; the cell answers that input
//! with one row per decision in its chronicle ([`rows`]). It asks for the
//! recorded instances of a fact an article requires with
//! `source: {facts: <regulation>#<article>#<fact>}` (schema v0.8.7,
//! RFC-051), one row per executogram ([`executogram_rows`]); the article's
//! `requires` entry for that fact says what each holds. For the logic
//! it calls law or policy like any rulework (`source.regulation`); where
//! that rulework reads an open term the cell answers, the cell answers it
//! there too.
//!
//! What a reduction yields is the answer to an open term of a law, which
//! it names with `implements` (schema v0.8.5): the lexostatus the cell
//! answers. Reduction takes place in the cell, and the cell hands the
//! lexostatus to the process that asks for it (RFC-022). So the engine does
//! not run the reduction: where an article reads the term, at any depth of
//! the execution, the engine asks the cell ([`Reader`], an
//! [`OpenTermAnswerer`]), and records who answered, from which reduction
//! and how far into the chronicle. The cell runs its reduction itself and
//! explains its answer on request ([`crate::Cell::explain_answer`]). The law
//! names no reduction and no cell: without one, the term is what it is
//! without an answer, such as a finding of the deciding authority. So a
//! scenario or another system can supply the same value.
//!
//! Each row carries the decision's `id`, and a field of type `decision`
//! holds the id of the decision it names, as the chronolexogram keeps it.
//! So a reduction can link a decision to another that refers to it, such as
//! a decision on an objection to the decision it contests (RFC-050). A row
//! holds only what its own chronolexogram holds: whether another decision
//! revoked it, a reduction reads from the rows of that other decision.
//!
//! The reductions are loaded into the service for the length of one
//! decision ([`load`]), so the cell can run them there; they go when the
//! [`Loaded`] guard drops, so an error or a panic during the decision leaves
//! nothing behind.
