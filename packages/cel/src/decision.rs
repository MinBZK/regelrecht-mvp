//! What the cell records a decision on an application with, derived from
//! the law (RFC-047).
//!
//! An article that establishes an application and decides on it follows a
//! procedure (RFC-008). The decision runs at the stage BESLUIT and is made
//! known at the stage BEKENDMAKING; at each, the engine names the articles
//! that take part ([`LawExecutionService::procedure_stage`]). The cell runs
//! them with, in this order of preference:
//!
//! 1. the application: a parameter of the deciding article, or one the
//!    application holds or gives (a hook's output) by the same name;
//! 2. what the deciding authority supplies, such as a parameter of a hook the
//!    application does not hold;
//! 3. the day of the decision, for a date the stage requires.
//!
//! An open term is no input. A policy that fills it (`implements`) is the
//! engine's to run, and its value is the term's (RFC-048 §2). A term that
//! nothing fills and that the law or policy leaves to the authority per
//! case (`decided_per_case_by`) is a finding of the authority, which the
//! cell keeps among the fields. Which terms those are, the engine says
//! ([`LawExecutionService::decision_terms`]). What a process asks of whom,
//! and when, is not the cell's.
