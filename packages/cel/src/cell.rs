//! A cell: it keeps a chronicle and records submissions and the decisions
//! on them in it.
//!
//! A submission may refer to a decision in the chronicle (`refers_to`). A
//! field of type `decision` then holds that decision, and a field that the
//! decision holds by name comes from it too (RFC-050). The chronolexogram
//! keeps a decision by its id; the engine gets its decision value
//! `{grondslag, taken_on, fields, findings, outputs}`, where `taken_on`
//! is the article of the submission it was taken on. A decision output of
//! the deciding article is a decision the cell records as well, in the same
//! append. The cell knows no article that does this; the law names it with
//! the type.
