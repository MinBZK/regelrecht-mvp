//! # regelrecht-law-model
//!
//! The canonical Rust representation of the law-YAML document model — the shape
//! of the files under `corpus/regulation/`. This crate is a dependency-light
//! leaf (serde + serde_json, no engine/runtime deps) that every consumer of the
//! law format can depend on, so the model is defined **once** instead of being
//! re-derived per crate.
//!
//! Scope: document structs/enums plus allocation-free accessors, and
//! [`stored`]: the lossless JSON form of a `Value` and the rule two stored
//! values are compared by. It deliberately contains no YAML loading, security
//! limits or evaluation logic — the engine owns those
//! (`regelrecht_engine::article::LawLoad` for loading, the resolver for
//! execution) and re-exports these types so existing paths keep working.
//!
//! The JSON schema under `schema/` remains the authoritative specification
//! (RFC-013); this crate is one conforming representation of it.
