/**
 * Variants the user saves themselves, in the browser.
 *
 * Why this exists: "save as variant" used to create a git branch in the case
 * checkout. Hosted, there is no checkout, and since the move to the monorepo
 * the path is wrong locally too. That left no way at all to keep a change: a
 * reloaded page threw everything away. This is that way.
 *
 * What a browser variant is: the same shape as a checked-in variant from
 * `variants.json` (`{ id, title, files }`), so the rest of the app need not
 * know the difference. The only differences are where the text comes from, and
 * `origin: 'browser'`, so the UI can mark it.
 *
 * What it deliberately is not: a shareable variant. It lives in this browser,
 * on this device, and is gone when someone clears their browser data. The text
 * at the button says so too; a variant that silently disappears is worse than
 * one that says up front that it can.
 *
 * About drift: every variant keeps, per file, a fingerprint of the text it was
 * made on. When the corpus later differs, the edit was made on a law that no
 * longer reads that way. `checkDrift` reports that; the app still lets the
 * variant activate, but says it belongs to an older version of the law. This
 * is exactly why edited YAML did not belong in plain persisted state (see the
 * header of useBewaardeStand), so without this check we would repeat that
 * mistake.
 *
 * About space: localStorage fills up around 5 MB and a law here is ~50 KB, so
 * about forty variants fit. Hence the fingerprint instead of the whole base
 * text, and hence `saveVariant` failing loudly when storage is full: a "saved"
 * that turns out to be gone after a reload is worse than a refusal.
