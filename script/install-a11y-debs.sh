# Install the packages the docs accessibility gate needs inside the Playwright
# image, without apt. Used by the docs-a11y job in .github/workflows/ci.yml.
#
# The image lacks two things the gate needs. Puppeteer unpacks its Chrome
# download with `unzip`. Without DejaVu, fontconfig resolves `monospace` to a
# CJK font (WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono) whose wider glyphs make code blocks
# overflow, and axe then reports them as scrollable regions without keyboard
# access (it did on /components/demo).
#
# Why not `apt-get install`: the image's apt sources point at the Azure Ubuntu
# mirror, the same one the runners use, and on a bad day that mirror serves
# packages at a few kB/s; a C compiler once took 22 minutes there. `apt-get
# update` also downloads some 34 MB of indexes for 1.5 MB of packages. These
# are the exact .debs `apt-get install --no-install-recommends unzip
# fonts-dejavu-core` picks in the image (fonts-dejavu-mono is a dependency of
# fonts-dejavu-core), so dpkg installs the same files, fontconfig
# configuration included.
#
# Source: Launchpad's copy of the Ubuntu archive. The librarian keeps every
# version that was ever published, so a URL keeps working after noble-updates
# moves on; the archive pool drops superseded versions.
#
# The list is only right for the image ci.yml pins. To refresh it after
# moving to a newer Playwright image, run in that image:
#   apt-get update
#   apt-get install --no-install-recommends --print-uris -y unzip fonts-dejavu-core
# and put each listed file name below, with the SHA256 that
#   apt-cache show <package>=<version>
# prints for it (from the signed package index). Check it against the file at
#   https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/<file>
