# RFC-006: Language Choice for Law Execution Engine

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-01-26
**Authors:** regelrecht team

## Context

The law execution engine requires a language that supports:

1. **Browser deployment**: The engine must run in the frontend editor via WebAssembly (WASM)
2. **Deterministic execution**: Legal requirement - identical inputs must always produce identical outputs
3. **Type safety**: Schema conformance should be verifiable at compile time
4. **AI-aided development**: The team uses Claude Code as primary development tool

A Python prototype exists (`engine/`) demonstrating the execution model. The question is which language to use for the production implementation.

## Decision

Use **Rust** for the law execution engine.

## Why

### Benefits

| Requirement | How Rust Addresses It |
|-------------|----------------------|
| WASM compilation | First-class support via `wasm-pack` and `wasm-bindgen`. Produces small, fast binaries. |
| Determinism | Compiler enforces: no implicit type coercion, no null exceptions, exhaustive pattern matching, precise integer types. |
| Type safety | Strong static types catch schema violations at compile time. `Result` and `Option` make error handling explicit. |
| AI-aided development | Type system provides actionable feedback loop: generate → compile → fix errors → repeat. |

**Additional benefits:**

- Memory safety without garbage collector (important for WASM performance)
- No runtime exceptions from null/undefined
- Pattern matching aligns well with rule-based logic
- `serde` provides robust YAML/JSON parsing with compile-time validation

### Tradeoffs

| Tradeoff | Mitigation |
|----------|------------|
| Learning curve (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes) | AI assistance reduces friction; team can learn iteratively |
| Slower iteration (compile times) | Incremental compilation; WASM hot-reload tooling exists |
| More verbose than Python | Explicitness is a feature for legal code; reduces ambiguity |
| Smaller ecosystem than Python for data processing | Core requirements are well-supported |

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1: Python (keep current prototype)**
- **Pro:** Team knows it well, fast iteration, extensive ecosystem
- **Pro:** Pyodide enables WASM compilation
- **Con:** Pyodide adds 11MB+ runtime overhead to WASM bundle
- **Con:** Type safety is runtime-only (mypy/pyright are optional, not enforced)
- **Con:** Implicit type coercion can cause subtle bugs
- **Why not:** WASM bundle size and lack of compile-time guarantees are deal-breakers

**Alternative 2: TypeScript**
- **Pro:** Runs natively in browser, no WASM needed
- **Pro:** Good tooling, wide adoption
- **Con:** JavaScript runtime has type coercion issues (`"1" + 1 = "11"`)
- **Con:** No compile-time exhaustiveness for pattern matching
- **Con:** `null` vs `undefined` ambiguity
- **Why not:** Runtime type coercion undermines determinism guarantees

**Alternative 3: Go**
- **Pro:** Simple language, fast compilation
- **Pro:** WASM support via TinyGo
- **Con:** TinyGo WASM has limitations (no reflection, reduced stdlib)
- **Con:** Less expressive type system than Rust (no sum types, no pattern matching)
- **Why not:** Type system insufficiently expressive for rule logic

### AI-Aided Development Assessment

Rust works well with AI code generation:

1. **Compiler as reviewer**: Type errors provide specific, actionable feedback that AI can use to self-correct
2. **Pattern matching**: AI generates idiomatic Rust with `match` expressions for rule logic
3. **Result handling**: Explicit error types guide AI toward correct error handling
4. **No runtime surprises**: If it compiles, many bug classes are eliminated

The generate → compile → fix cycle with Rust is faster than generate → run → debug with dynamic languages.
