/**
 * Where the walkthrough meets the graph's camera.
 *
 * Panning and zooming the graph (vue-flow) happens through dragging and the
 * mouse wheel, which the action log does not see: there is no element that
 * was clicked. So the graph reports where it looks, and the replay tells it
 * where to look. Both as the point in the middle of the pane, in graph
 * coordinates, plus the zoom: a position in pixels would land elsewhere on a
 * screen of another size.
 *
 * Dragging a law aside is the same kind of action: the graph reports which
 * node moved and by how much from where the layout put it, and the replay
 * moves it there again. Relative to the layout, so a take still lands right
 * after the layout itself shifted.
 *
 * GraafView fills `graphView.api` while it is mounted; the recorder sets
 * `graphView.onView` and `graphView.onNodeMove` while a take runs.
