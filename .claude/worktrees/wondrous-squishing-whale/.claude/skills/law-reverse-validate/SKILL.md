# Law Reverse Validate — Hallucination Check

Verifies that every element in `machine_readable` sections traces back to the
original legal text. This catches invented logic, phantom conditions, and
hallucinated operations that aren't grounded in the law.

## Instructions

1. Read the target law YAML file
2. For each article that has a `machine_readable` section:
   a. Read the article's `text` field carefully
   b. Check every element in the `machine_readable` section:
      - Every `input` field — is it referenced in the legal text?
      - Every `parameter` — is it needed by the legal text?
      - Every `definition` — does the value match the legal text exactly?
      - Every `action` and its `operation` — does the legal text describe this logic?
      - Every comparison value — does the legal text state this threshold/amount?
      - Every `source.regulation` reference — does the legal text reference that law?
      - Every `endpoint` — is there a reason for external callability?

3. Classify each element:

| Traceable in text? | Needed for logic? | Action |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| YES | YES | Keep |
| YES | NO | Keep (informational) |
| NO | YES | Report as assumption |
| NO | NO | **Remove** |

4. For elements classified as "Remove": delete them from the YAML using Edit
5. For elements classified as "Report as assumption": collect them for the report
6. **After any removals:** re-run `just validate <file>` to ensure the file still
   passes schema validation. Removing elements can break required field constraints
   or leave dangling `$variable` references. Fix any validation errors before
   completing the report.
