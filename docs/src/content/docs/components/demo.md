title: "Demo"
description: "The RegelRecht demo: a presentation, the laws and their graph, scenarios, a population simulation, a citizen portal and a case system, with the engine running as WASM in the browser."
---

The demo shows in one workspace what RegelRecht does: the machine-readable law, the dependencies between laws, the scenarios that test a law, and the execution for one person on a portal and in a case system. It succeeds the separate `poc-machine-law` repository.

## Overview

- **Language**: Vue 3 / Vite, `@nldd/design-system`
- **Location**: `frontend-demo/`
- **Corpus**: `corpus/demo/`
- **Production URL**: `demo.regelrecht.rijks.app` (ZAD component `demo`; see [Deployment](/operations/deployment))
- **Interface languages**: Dutch (the source), English under `/en/` and Frisian under `/fy/`. The Frisian translation has not yet been reviewed by a Frisian speaker. The law texts themselves stay Dutch in every language, because a translation of the text in force has no legal standing.

## What it does

The workspace opens on a landing page (the house icon) with a short explanation, a button that starts the presentation, and a QR code that points at the demo itself, so someone in the audience can follow along on a phone. After it come eight tabs, in the order of a presentation. The labels below are the English ones, with the Dutch in parentheses.

1. **Presentation** (*Presentatie*): the slide deck in Rijkshuisstijl blue. The intro is shown full screen; after that the deck sits on the left as a rail, and each slide opens the tab it is about, switches persona and points at what the presenter means. The slides are content (`demo-config.yaml`), not code. Each persona has its own deck: a slide with `decks` belongs to that persona's story, the other slides are shared, and the deck is picked from the chosen persona when the presentation starts. Merijn's deck ends with Claudia; Claudia's deck stays with her, from the precario by-law to the terrace permit the municipality grants. A slide that names no law (`/regelwerken`) opens the chosen persona's `default_law`. Esc closes the deck and leaves the demo where it is; Shift+P opens it from anywhere.
2. **Ruleworks** (*Regelwerken*): the rulework of a law as a collapsible YAML tree, prepared per story (`expanded_paths` in `demo-config.yaml`: a path opens itself and everything above it, the rest stays closed; `folded_paths` names nodes on such a path that start closed for the presenter to open, with what lies below them already prepared). Every `source.regulation` is a link that opens the referenced law; a back button retraces the references followed. The list of all laws, grouped per organization, is a side panel that is closed by default.
3. **Graph** (*Graaf*): per law its sources, its inputs from other laws and its outputs, with lines to the law that supplies them, the persona's values on them, and one color per organization. The profile picks the laws of its story (`graph_laws`), and the graph shows those laws plus everything directly attached to them. A profile with `graph_focus` puts that law in focus and zooms in on it when the persona is chosen, the way Ruleworks and Scenarios open the profile's `default_law` and `default_feature`. The layout of the whole corpus is fixed, so "All" (*Alles*) adds laws without moving anything. Selecting a law colors the lines it reads from green and the lines along which other laws read it red.
4. **Scenarios** (*Scenario's*): the Gherkin scenarios per law. In Dutch the steps are rendered as Dutch sentences; English and Frisian show the canonical English steps, which is what the `.feature` files contain. "Run" (*Uitvoeren*) executes a scenario in the browser against the engine and opens the full execution trace, in which each law has its own color and a bar steps from one law to the next.
5. **Simulation** (*Simulatie*): a generated population of citizens or businesses (size, age and income distribution, business type, seed) is run through every regulation of that portal. The result shows who qualifies and for how much, broken down by age, income, partner, business type or size, and for citizens the disposable income per month: income minus taxes, plus allowances and benefits. Which outputs count, and whether per month or per year, is set in `simulation.disposable_income`. A law that another law reads as a decided case (the precario tax reads the granted terrace permit) is applied for first by the businesses that apply, and what it grants becomes a case before the rest runs. Constants from the laws (thresholds, percentages) can be changed per run, and so can those of the regulations the laws rely on, such as the standard premium (*standaardpremie*) that a ministerial regulation fills in for the zorgtoeslag. A run is named after what it changed and a variant gets its own color; runs sit side by side for comparison, which opens with the disposable income per run, and export as CSV or JSON.

6. **My government** (*Mijn overheid*; the label comes from `portal_tab_label` in `demo-config.yaml`, and on behalf of a business it is the business's name. A persona with `start_namens` opens on behalf of that business, as Claudia does for her café; with the authorizations feature on, *Mezelf* (myself) shows her own portal as a citizen): the portal of the active persona. Each regulation is computed live. Under "Data used" (*Gebruikte gegevens*) the portal shows where each piece of data comes from, and each one can be corrected. A regulation that ends in a *beschikking* (an individual administrative decision) is applied for from the portal, in a panel that follows the flow of the POC: the law computes with what the government already knows and asks, one question at a time, only for what no register holds (the rent, the location of a café terrace). It recomputes after each answer, lets the applicant check the outcome and the data used, and shows the status after submission. An application under a law listed in `review_laws` (Rotterdam's terrasvergunning) always goes to a caseworker, whatever the law concludes. Once the decision has been announced, the panel shows the date until which an objection (*bezwaar*) is possible. That date comes from the Awb itself (articles 6:7 and 6:8), not from the screen. The portal never jumps to the case system, which belongs to the other side of the counter.

   ![The My government tab for the persona Merijn: one card per regulation (kindgebonden budget, zorgtoeslag, bijstand, huurtoeslag, inkomstenbelasting) with the computed outcome, the number of data items used, and buttons to apply, see the calculation or read the law text.](../../../assets/portaal-screenshot.png)

7. **Citizen** (*Burger*): what happens outside government as a result of its decisions, for the active persona or the party acted for. Per party that is not government (`consequences` in `demo-config.yaml`), it shows what that party's cell recorded about the persona. For now that is the fictional bank: the account number, the balance (opening balance plus what the bank credited, minus what it debited) and every credited, debited or refused transfer or incasso, from the bank's chronicle. The party's name comes from `services.yaml`; a health insurer or an employer would be another entry in the list, with its own `view`. A bank account does not belong in *Mijn overheid*, which is why this is a screen of its own.

8. **Case system** (*Zaaksysteem*): the case handler's side, per executing organization. It has a board with cases to assess, cases to announce and cases that have been announced, the regulations the organization executes, the engine's recalculation next to the result applied for, citizen corrections awaiting review, granting or refusing, announcing, and objection. Announcing is a separate action, because the Awb treats the decision (article 1:3) and its announcement (article 3:41) as two moments, and only the second starts the objection period. By default the demo announces a decision as soon as it is taken ("Announce decisions straight away" in the menu); switching that off brings the announcement back as a step of its own.

The toolbar switches the profile (Merijn, a citizen; Claudia, a business owner). With the authorizations feature on, "Acting for" offers the people or businesses the active profile may act for, when the law gives more than one option. The menu then holds four groups:

- **Features**: switches for features that are off or on per profile in `demo-config.yaml` (authorizations, reporting a change, harmonization, approving corrections immediately), plus "Review every application by hand" and "Announce decisions straight away" (on by default). A switched flag overrides the profile until "Back to the profile" resets it.
- **Language**: Dutch, English or Frisian.
- **Appearance**: the color scheme.
- **Demo**: full screen, and resetting the demo.

## How it works

The demo corpus in `corpus/demo/` holds the laws migrated from the POC (`regulation/nl/`, schema v0.5.8 and v0.5.9, with `source: {}` for external data), their scenarios (`**/scenarios/*.feature`, in the canonical grammar), `bindings.yaml` (which register table and column feeds which `source: {}` input), `profiles.yaml` (the fictitious personas), `demo-config.yaml` and `services.yaml`. `tools/` holds the one-off migration and conversion scripts.

Everything the demo computes happens in the browser; the one exception is the optional "why" explanation below. The engine runs as WebAssembly in the browser, the same engine as in the editor. At build time the demo corpus is copied to `public/data`. Persona data (`profiles.yaml`) is materialized per law into records through `bindings.yaml` and registered with the engine as a law-scoped data source; approved citizen corrections are layered on top as a second source with a higher priority. Applications, corrections and settings live in `localStorage`, so a page refresh during a presentation loses nothing.

An application for a *beschikking* passes through the phases the Awb gives it (RFC-007, RFC-008). In each phase the engine fires the hooks that belong to it and reports which piece of data it still lacks; the demo supplies it at the moment it exists, and stores the state with the case. That is how the objection period arrives as a date from the law, and how a special law that departs from article 6:7 is taken into account without extra code.

### The application as a fact in a chronicle

For zorgtoeslag the application and the decision on it are also recorded as facts in a chronicle (chronolex, [RFC-022](/rfcs/rfc-022)). The cell of the Belastingdienst/Toeslagen (`corpus/demo/cells/toeslagen`) runs in the browser next to the engine: the demo loads one WASM module, `regelrecht-cel` built with its `wasm` feature, which exports both the engine (`WasmEngine`) and the cell (`WasmCell`).

What the application contains is not configured but follows from executing the law. Awir article 15 establishes the application; because Zorgtoeslagwet article 2 takes a *beschikking* on it, Awb 4:2 (the core of every application) and 4:13 (the receipt is the moment that counts) hook onto it, and Awir 16 asks for the income the applicant expects. The portal shows these fields under "What the law asks", each with the article that asks it, and on submission the cell records the application.

Zorgtoeslagwet article 2 follows the procedure of the Awir (`tegemoetkoming`), with two decisions: the voorschot (stage VOORSCHOT) and the toekenning (stage TOEKENNING). At the voorschot, Awir 16 replaces the toetsingsinkomen with the estimate and gives the voorschotbedrag. When the case is decided, the case system records the decision of the stage the case is at: the cell reads what that stage asks back from its chronicle, executes that one stage, and records the outputs of article 2 and of the hooks at that stage (Awb 3:46 and 6:7 among them). The case system shows the grams under "Chronicle" on the case.

The cell also records each voorschot instalment, as an executogram. Awir 22 says per month whether an instalment falls due, and Toeslagen's (fictional) policy says how much it is; the cell executes that policy for a month and records a gram only when the law says one arises. At the toekenning the cell reads what was paid up to that moment from its chronicle: Awir 24 sets it off against the award, giving an amount still to pay and an amount to recover as two outcomes, and Awir 26a leaves an amount of at most € 118 (the 2025 text; € 121 in the 2026 text, which the toekenning over 2026 applies) unrecovered. After the toekenning no instalment is paid. The grams are kept in `localStorage` with the rest of the demo state (key `rr-demo-state-v5`; an older state is not converted).

The cell reads what a decision asks of the application from the application itself, as the law describes it. Everything else, such as the voorschot and what was paid on it, it reads back with an article in Toeslagen's (fictional) policy, `fictief_beleid_kroniek_toeslagen`, written in the same rule language as the law. Its articles read the chronicle as an input without a source (`source: {}`); `registers:` in `cell.yaml` binds that input to the chronicle `toeslagen`, and the cell registers it with the engine as a data source scoped to that policy, holding the grams that count at the moment of reading.

An instalment is paid through a bank. Toeslagen records a payment order (`betaalopdracht_gegeven`: amount, the account the applicant gave in the application, execution date). A second cell, a fictional bank (`corpus/demo/cells/bank`), receives it and credits or refuses it under its own fictional terms (`fictieve_bankvoorwaarden`); Toeslagen receives that answer and records the instalment as paid or the payment as failed. Only credited payments count in the settlement. A refused amount goes along with the next month's order. The demo carries the messages between the cells; which gram goes to which cell and which field fills which parameter is configured under `channels` in `demo-config.yaml`, and what arises at the receiving end is decided by its rules (`WasmCell.receive`). A message holds from the moment of the gram it carries, so the bank's answer to the order of a month the clock skipped lies before the next month's order. A message that does not arrive goes into an outbox in the demo state and is offered again on every clock step and on load; the case shows the error for as long as the message is in the outbox. A cell records one answer per message and refuses a second one (error name `answered`), which the outbox counts as delivered: Toeslagen by the order the answer refers to, the bank by the betaalkenmerk of the transfer (`identified_by` in its terms). A cell refuses a receipt that has neither of the two. Channels that loop leave the message that started the loop in the outbox, marked as a loop, and it is not offered again until the channels change. The Citizen screen shows the persona's account at the fictional bank, with the balance and the transfers from the bank's chronicle. The account data (opening balance, `geblokkeerd`) is in the persona's `BANK` data in `profiles.yaml`.

Each of the two decisions is announced on its own: the procedure of the Awir has a stage after the voorschot and after the toekenning that *is* a BEKENDMAKING, so Awb 6:8 fires per decision and each has its own objection period. That list of stages is a modelling choice, since the Awir itself gives none; it follows Awb 3:40 and 3:41, which apply per decision.

### Time in the demo

The demo has one clock: the reference date (`referenceDate` in the demo state). Everything that happens in a case happens on that day, at the time of day of the wall clock: the submission, the decision, the announcement and the grams. The clock only moves forward. A gram never lies in the future (RFC-050), so the way back is to reset the demo.

The Chronicle view of a case in the case system shows the facts as a timeline, and below them what the law gives as the next moment, as an expectation and not as a gram. The cell executes the law without recording to find these: the next day with an instalment (the cell gives the days an instalment is executed on, from Awir 22 and the policy, and the demo asks each one), the end of the year the decision concerns, the day a cell takes a decision ex officio about the person of the case (the aanslag the toekenning waits for), the day the holder's policy gives a decision on the case, and the dates the law gives a decision, such as the latest date of the toekenning (Awir 19) or of the payment (Awir 24). Of a decision still to come it shows only the dates that do not move with the day the decision is taken: a demo heuristic that compares two previews of the decision in different calendar months. "To the next moment" sets the reference date to the earliest of these and lets the cell record what arises for every open case: an instalment for each day the cell gives as due, and a decision whose moment has come. That decision is taken by the demo itself when applications are not reviewed by hand (as at submission), and otherwise lands in the "to review" lane, with what the law would decide at that stage, the settlement included. A decision after the first of its kind (the voorschot or toekenning of a following year, the terugvordering) the demo takes with the outcome the law gives, a refusal included: a refusal is a decision too (Awb 1:3), and recording it lets the next year follow. The same holds for a refused toekenning on a case that already has its voorschot: it is recorded, and the terugvordering of what was paid follows. Only a refusal of the first decision on the application is not recorded: the demo ends the case there, and the decisions the cell would build on it do not belong to a case that has ended. A decision whose day the holder's policy gives (the toekenning, on the day of the aanslag) is not offered to the caseworker before that day. When the law cannot decide such a year yet, the case says so per year.

The case system also shows the chronicle from the back: "Chronicle" at the top of the board, next to "Cases", lists every gram the cell of that organisation has stored, for all cases, in the order of `recorded_at`. Each gram shows the case it belongs to (the application its references lead back to), when it counts (`effective_at` with its legal basis) next to when it was recorded, and where it comes from. That origin has two sides: what the law says in its own terms, from the shape the cell derives from it (`WasmCell.shape`: the establishing article, the legal character, the stage, and per article or hook the fields it asks for), and the registration in the cell's stream (the event name, the stream's `$id` and file, `establishes`, `stage`). Each gram has one legal basis, the article that establishes it. Under each article or hook that asks for fields, every field shows its own grondslag as the gram records it (`field_basis`), or "zonder grondslag" when no article says it in so many words; a field that rests on an article of a fictitious policy shows that article as it is. Every provision (the establishing article, the legal basis, the basis of the moment, the article or hook behind the fields, the grondslag of each field) links to its article under Rulework, which opens and shows the article named in the query (`?artikel=4:13`; a lid opens its article, a law outside the demo corpus is shown without a link). References between grams link to the gram referred to, the inputs of a decision show their provenance, and each gram opens as the JSON line the cell keeps. "See how the cell stores this" on a case opens this view filtered on that case.

"Lexostatuses", the third view next to "Cases" and "Chronicle", shows what the cell derives from its chronicle to take a decision, in words a reader without the configuration can follow. It opens with one line naming the cell and saying what a lexostatus is ("Cel Dienst Toeslagen. Een lexostatus is wat Dienst Toeslagen op de peildatum uit haar eigen kroniek afleidt, om een besluit te kunnen nemen."), the cell's name taken from `services.yaml`. Each lexostatus is a card (`nldd-card`). Its heading says what it is and its name, "Wat er in de aanvraag staat · lexostatus `aanvraag`"; for an article of the holder's policy, which has no heading of its own, it names the values the article gives. Under the heading one sentence says which events get which values ("Geeft “Voorschot verleend” en “Zorgtoeslag toegekend” 3 gegevens: BSN, aangevraagd berekeningsjaar en datum ontvangst."). The card then shows the shape of what it gives as a small schema, `{ bsn: tekst, aangevraagd_berekeningsjaar: getal, datum_ontvangst: datum }`, with the unit where the article declares one ("bedrag in eurocent"), and "Vastgelegd in" with a link to the article that lays the shape down: the law (Awir 15) for the application, the policy article otherwise. A table lists each value: its label, its technical name and type, which parameter of which article asks for it (the interface the law sets: an article of a reading event, or of a hook at its stage, with a parameter of the same name), how the cell derives it (the implementation: "ingevuld in de aanvraag", "de dag waarop de aanvraag binnenkwam", or the description the policy article gives), and its legal basis. Below that, per case and per berekeningsjaar, the values on the reference date and the grams they were read from, each linking to that gram in the Chronicle view. "Show technical details" shows the name, the events that read it, the inputs, and the event or the register binding. The sentences are built from what the cell describes (`WasmCell.lexostatuses`, `WasmCell.readLexostatus`, `WasmCell.shape`) and from the ruleworks, in `frontend-demo/src/data/lexostatusView.js`; the demo names no lexostatus itself. A link to an article the demo corpus does not contain (the demo's Awir lacks article 13) opens that article on wetten.overheid.nl instead of the rulework without it.

The reference date can also be set directly under Demo in the menu ("Reference date"). A later date runs the clock in the same way, recording what arises along the way. An earlier date is only accepted while nothing has been recorded; with cases or grams, going back means resetting the demo, because a fact never lies in the future.

A decision may ask for a fact from the file of the administrative body that the cell does not read from its own chronicle: a parameter with origin `DOSSIER`. Where the demo finds it is configured under `dossier` in `demo-config.yaml`, in the shape of a binding (table, column, `select_on`, `absent`). The zorgtoeslag process no longer uses it: the aanslag inkomstenbelasting is a decision of a third cell, the Belastingdienst (`corpus/demo/cells/belastingdienst`), which the clock takes on the day the inspecteur's fictitious planning gives, for the person of each open case with an application in a chronicle (`ex_officio` in `demo-config.yaml`). A channel carries its inkomensgegeven to Toeslagen, and the toekenning rests on that fact: its day and its toetsingsinkomen. After the toekenning Toeslagen pays a nabetaling through the bank, or takes a terugvordering (Awir 26) as a decision of its own and collects it by incasso from the persona's account. [Zorgtoeslag as Chronolexography](/components/zorgtoeslag-chronolexography) describes how.

On the portal, the application shows what was received so far (the lexostatus the cell reads for the amounts paid, named under `received` in `demo-config.yaml`; the demo adds nothing up itself), each decision with its amounts and dates, and what is still to come.

### The "why" explanation

A portal tile can explain its outcome in plain language, as the "waarom?" link in `poc-machine-law` did. A language model writes the explanation from the engine's trace and the outcome as the tile shows it, in the language the demo is set to. The sheet that shows it says it was written by a language model and that the calculation stands where the two differ.

The feature is off until the presenter unlocks it with a password under Demo in the menu. The password is kept in `localStorage` under its own key (`rr-demo-why-password`), so resetting the demo leaves it in place. The server checks it on every request; the browser only passes it on.

The model runs through the Claude Code CLI, in a small Node server (`frontend-demo/server/why.mjs`) that nginx reaches on `127.0.0.1:7401` inside the same container. A subscription token from `claude setup-token` only works through that CLI, which is why this is a server and not a call from the browser. The server gives the CLI no tools and no settings, allows three explanations at a time, and stops the model when the visitor closes the sheet. It does not lock out after wrong guesses, because a lockout shared by every caller would let one script keep the presenter out; instead it refuses to start with a password shorter than 16 characters.

Without a server behind `/api/why` the app does not show the feature at all: no menu item, no button. That is the case for a plain `just demo` and for a deployment without the variables below.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `DEMO_WHY_PASSWORD` | The password that unlocks the button, at least 16 characters. Without it the server does not start |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Token for the Claude Code CLI (from `claude setup-token`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Alternative to the token: a Console key, billed per call |
| `DEMO_WHY_MODEL` | Model alias for the CLI, default `sonnet` |

## The recorded walkthrough

Next to the live presentation there is a recorded one at `/rondleiding` (`/en/tour`), for people who go through the demo without a presenter. The home page and the Presentation tab only offer it when the build carries a recording.

The walkthrough is not a video of the demo. It is the presenter's voice, and while it plays the demo itself does what the presenter did: the deck changes slides and opens tabs, and buttons are clicked and text is typed, letter by letter at the recorded pace, in the live app. A cursor moves to each click a moment before it happens. The deck is the same rail as in the zelfstandig mode of the presentation, with playback controls in its footer, the presenter's face in a circle under the slide, and the frequently asked questions that have come up so far. Pausing hands the demo to the viewer, who can click around; playing again restores the recorded state of that moment and goes on.

The controls are design-system buttons in the deck's footer: play and pause, previous and next chapter (one chapter per slide), a chapter menu, and a menu with playback speed, captions, the presenter bubble, a transcript per chapter, and the way out. The keys are Space to pause, the arrows for chapters and Escape to leave a question; there are no single-letter shortcuts (WCAG 2.1.4). The controls follow the viewer's language; the demo under them runs in Dutch for the length of the walkthrough, because the voice names its Dutch labels and the replay finds what to click by them, and a note next to the controls says so. If the media fail to load, the page says there is no walkthrough instead of waiting. While the walkthrough plays these keys belong to the player, also when the replay left focus in a field it typed into. A question appears in the rail when the presenter mentions it; its answer has its own address (`/rondleiding/<id>`), and leaving it resumes the main line where the viewer was. While an answer plays, every slide carries the question as its title.

The walkthrough also hands the demo to the viewer. Where the presenter says something like "kijk gerust even zelf rond" or "ga je gang", the player stops at the end of that sentence and a coach mark (`nldd-just-in-time-education`) at the play button invites the viewer to click around; the button then reads "Verder". The build finds these sentences in the corrected transcript by a fixed list of phrases (`INVITATIONS` in `script/walkthrough/walkthrough/timeline.py`), places each pause through the cuts like any other event, and writes them to `timeline.json` as `pauses`. A take can switch the detection off with `auto_pauses: false`, and `pauses:` in `walkthrough.yaml` adds one by hand (`{take, at, hint}`) or removes a found one (`{take, at, off: true}`). A pause only stops a clock that runs into it; a jump past it does not.

When the viewer clicks into the demo while it plays, the player pauses and shows the same coach mark ("Ga je gang"). If `walkthrough.yaml` has `bumpers`, short stretches of a take in the presenter's own voice, it also says one of the `wait` lines ("ga je gang, kijk maar even rond, ik wacht"), and on Continue one of the `resume` lines ("oké, we gaan verder") while the demo is put back the way it was. Each is rendered to its own small audio file, as loud as the walkthrough, published with the rest of the media and picked at random. They play through a separate audio element, so they never move the walkthrough's clock.

Answers come in two kinds. A judgement (how open norms are handled, what the legal status of a translation is) is the presenter on camera: a recorded take on a slide without a tab, where the face is shown large next to the question. A let-me-show-you answer is a scripted chapter in the generated voice, with the demo clicking along; it can open with a recorded sentence on camera. Both are segments, as in the main line.

How the replay holds up:

- **Finding elements.** A data attribute that holds an id made up at run time (the id of a simulation run or of a case) or a passing state (the menu item that had focus) is left out of the description. A click is stored as a description of the element, not a position: per scope (the document, then each shadow root of a design-system component on the way) the element's tag and what names it to a person, such as its text, label or link. The replay looks that up in the live page. Links are stored without their origin, and when an exact match fails, numbers in labels ("Wetten, 79") are ignored. A recording made at one window width replays at another; this was checked between 1100 and 1920 pixels wide, with the rail next to the demo (`src/walkthrough/locator.js`).
- **Waiting.** An element that is not there yet, because a tab is still loading or the engine is computing, is waited for, and the voice pauses with it.
- **The date.** While a replay runs, `Date` answers with the moment of the recording plus the time into it (`clock.js`), so amounts and deadlines are those of the recording day.
- **Jumping.** Every chapter carries the demo state as it was when its slide came up. A jump restores that state, mounts the tabs fresh and replays the chapter's actions up to the target, fast.
- **The viewer's own session.** The replay drives the same store, but does not write it to `localStorage`, and leaving the walkthrough puts the viewer's own state back.

A presenter can switch the deck off during a take and go on through the tabs. That stretch has no slide changes, so it would be one long chapter with the last slide next to it. `chapters:` under the take in `walkthrough.yaml` gives it chapters afterwards: a moment in the take and the text of a slide. The recorder stored no state of the demo at those moments, so `just walkthrough states` plays the walkthrough once on the dev server, in real time, and stores the state at each added chapter in the take's folder; the next build gives those chapters their snapshot. Next to the deck the tab bar is hidden, so a recorded click on a tab that the replay cannot see is followed as the link it is. A recorded "Demo resetten" puts the demo in its default mode, which has no rail; the replay keeps the rail.

A take can also begin with the demo in a state the log does not explain: a scenario already run in a tab that was still open, for instance. `actions:` under the take adds the missing clicks, each with a moment and the description of its element.

A replay can still break when the demo changes: a button that is renamed or removed is no longer found. The replay then goes to the right tab itself (it also records the route of every navigation), but a click inside the tab is lost. Record the affected chapter again; a take can start at any slide.

In a window narrower than the one the take was recorded in, the demo next to the rail is scaled down to the recorded width (CSS `zoom`, never below 70 percent), so its lines break where they did for the presenter and what he scrolled to is on screen; the rail keeps its size. A recorded Escape closes the sheet, dialog or popover it was pressed in, which a made-up key event does not do by itself.

On a screen narrower than 1024 pixels the demo and the rail do not fit side by side. The page says so and points to a larger screen. It used to play the recording of the window as a video there, but that video shows the slides of the recording day, not the ones corrected afterwards, and nothing at all where the presenter had the deck off; the build no longer renders it.

The player's layer over the demo (the bubble, the cursor and its ripple, the captions) is custom CSS in `src/walkthrough/Replay*.vue`, because the design system has no video or pointer components. The cursor and the captions are placed in the browser's top layer, so they stay visible over a sheet or dialog the replay opens.

A sheet that opens on the left (the law list on the Laws tab, an `nldd-sheet` with `placement="left"`) is placed by the design system against the window edge, which with the deck as a rail is behind the slides. Until the design system has a hook for that edge, `src/presentation/sheetOffset.js` adds a rule to those components' shadow roots that moves the sheet, and its slide-in, to the edge of the demo while the rail is on screen. It depends on internal class names; `sheetOffset.test.js` fails when they change. This also applies to the live presentation in zelfstandig mode.

### Recording

```bash
just walkthrough record   # the demo on :7400 in Chrome, with the recorder panel
```

The recorder is a panel in the top left corner, present only in the dev server and only with `?record` in the address; the production bundle does not contain it, and the deployed site's `Permissions-Policy` blocks the microphone and camera anyway. A take is recorded the way it is played back: in Dutch, with the deck as a rail next to the demo. It records on one clock:

- the microphone (echo cancellation, noise suppression and automatic gain off);
- the webcam, optionally;
- the actions (`capture.js`): clicks, typing with its value after every keystroke, selects and checkboxes, Enter and Escape, scrolling, and the deck's slide changes and the routes;
- the whole window as video, which the correction step takes its stills from.

What is typed is recorded, because the replay has to type it again. It is demo input with fictitious personas, said aloud in the same take. The state of the demo is stored with every slide change, which is what a jump restores and what lets one chapter be recorded again from its own starting point.

During a take the panel leaves the screen and the tab title starts with "● REC". Shift+X marks a slip (say the sentence again from its start), Shift+R stops. Chunks stream to the Vite dev server, which writes them to `.walkthrough/takes/<take>/`; a crash loses seconds, not the take. The endpoint that writes them exists only under `just walkthrough record`, accepts only requests from the machine itself, and limits their size. Record in Chrome or Edge, which can capture their own tab without asking for a window.

### Post-processing

`script/walkthrough/` is a small Python project, run through `uv`:

```bash
just walkthrough prepare     # last take: extract, clean the voice, transcribe, correct, draft cuts
just walkthrough transcript  # the spoken text per slide
just walkthrough build       # walkthrough.yaml to voice, video, captions and timeline.json
just walkthrough states      # the demo's state at chapters added in walkthrough.yaml (dev server on)
just walkthrough status      # which takes exist and how far each one is processed
just walkthrough check       # how a take sounds, in numbers, with a verdict per line
just walkthrough script      # a draft script per slide of a take, for the generated voice
just walkthrough voices      # the voices on the ElevenLabs account
just walkthrough publish     # the media into a GitHub release (asks first)
just walkthrough test        # the tests of the cut and caption arithmetic
```

The voice is denoised with DeepFilterNet, filtered below 80 Hz, de-essed and compressed; loudness is normalized to -16 LUFS over the finished track, so every chapter is equally loud. WhisperX (Whisper large-v3 with a Dutch wav2vec2 aligner) gives every word a timestamp; the `glossary` from `walkthrough.yaml` goes into its prompt as a sentence, because Whisper copies the prompt's style and a bare list gave a transcript without full stops. Whisper still mishears policy vocabulary ("machine uit voorwaarde formaat", "bc-nummer" for the `bsn` on screen), so `prepare` has a language model read the transcript next: headless Claude Code (`claude -p`) gets the glossary, the slide texts, the labels of what was clicked and stills of the app taken from the recording (at every route change, every click and every six seconds) as context, and returns the same speech with the mishearings fixed, not rewritten. That text goes to `corrected.txt` in the take's folder and is matched back onto Whisper's timing letter by letter, so a corrected word keeps the time of the word it replaces. A correction that changes more than a fifth of the words is refused. To correct by hand, edit `corrected.txt`; `just walkthrough correct <take>` runs the check again. Captions are shortened after a build: spoken language makes long captions ("En dan zien we hier eigenlijk dat dat best wel een kluwen is"), and `just walkthrough subtitles` has a language model write a short subtitle for each caption that has none yet, without filler or repetition and with the terms and numbers as said. They land in `corpus/demo/walkthrough/subtitles.yaml`, keyed by what was said, for anyone to correct by hand; the next build shows them, in the captions and in the transcript panel. `prepare` then proposes cuts: long silences shortened, unless the presenter acted in them, and the sentence before each Shift+X. The proposal is a draft. The cuts that count are the ones in `corpus/demo/walkthrough/walkthrough.yaml`, which also lists the takes that make up the walkthrough, slide texts that replace the recorded ones, and the questions with the take of their answer and the moment they appear. A scroll is logged with what was in the middle of the scroller (an element with text, which one of its kind, and where in the visible box), not only its pixels: on a screen where the law wraps differently the same pixels land elsewhere, and the replay brings that line back to the same place instead. Scrollers inside design-system components are listened to directly, since a scroll event does not leave a shadow root. For a take recorded before this, `just walkthrough anchors` measures the anchors by replaying the walkthrough on the dev server in the layout the take was recorded in. DeepFilterNet, WhisperX and OpenCV (for finding the face in the webcam picture) each run in their own `uv` environment and are downloaded on first use; ffmpeg has to be installed.

`build` cuts every piece on whole frames, so the voice cannot drift from the picture over many cuts, and refuses a cut through typing. An action inside a cut is not dropped but moved to the cut, so the demo still ends up in the presenter's state. The timeline, the captions and `walkthrough.yaml` are in git under `corpus/demo/walkthrough/`; the media are not, because a re-recorded chapter would leave megabytes in the history for good. They are assets of the GitHub release named in `timeline.json`. The Docker build fetches them with `scripts/fetch-walkthrough-media.mjs` and refuses a file whose checksum differs. nginx serves them from `/walkthrough/` with a one-year cache, which is safe because a new recording means new file names.

### Generated chapters

A chapter can also be spoken from a script instead of a recording. The script is text with markers, in `corpus/demo/walkthrough/script/<name>.yaml`, next to a silent take that holds the clicks and typing for it:

```yaml
slide: 5
take: 2026-10-03T10-00-00
lines:
  - Hier ziet u de wet op de zorgtoeslag, zoals een computer hem leest.
  - Ik open [1] de lijst met wetten en zoek [2] de huurtoeslag.
```

`[n]` is where the n-th beat of the take starts: a run of actions without a pause longer than 1.2 seconds, such as a click and the typing after it. Navigation the deck does on its own is not a beat. Every beat has to appear in the script once. The voice is generated per line, with the time of every character; the actions land on the word after their marker, keep their recorded pace, and when a beat takes longer than the words around it the next line waits. The captions come from the script text, so they are exact. A walkthrough can mix both: in `walkthrough.yaml` a segment is either `take:` (recorded) or `script:` (generated), and the usual case is a recorded opening with the presenter's face, followed by generated chapters.

The voice is set in `walkthrough.yaml`:

```yaml
voice:
  provider: elevenlabs          # or `say`: the Mac's own voice, to try a script out
  voice_id: <the cloned voice>
  model: eleven_multilingual_v2
  say_as:                       # how a word is pronounced, not how it is written
    Awb: A-W-B
```

`elevenlabs` reads the API key from `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` or from `.walkthrough/.env`, which is not in git. Generated lines are cached by a hash of their text and voice settings, so a rebuild only pays for lines that changed. Where a track contains generated speech, the player says so next to its controls ("De stem in de hoofdstukken is gegenereerd met AI"), as the AI Act asks of generated speech that can pass for a person. The webcam bubble shows only during the recorded parts at the start (`cam.until`). On a full slide (the opening, or an answer without a tab) the bubble is large next to the slide; once a slide opens the demo it shrinks to a corner of the rail.

No track has a rendered recording of the window any more, so `walkthrough export` has nothing to turn into an MP4. A shareable MP4 has to be recorded from the replay itself, which is not built yet.

### From recording to release

The route for a new walkthrough, or for a chapter recorded again:

1. **Voice clone, once.** Record yourself giving the talk two or three times, freely and microphone only (QuickTime, high quality); that is the training audio. Create a Professional Voice Clone from it at ElevenLabs, put the API key in `.walkthrough/.env` with `read -s KEY && echo "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=$KEY" >> .walkthrough/.env`, and find the clone's id with `just walkthrough voices`. It goes in `walkthrough.yaml` under `voice.voice_id`, with `provider: elevenlabs`.
2. **Record.** `just walkthrough record`. The opening as a take with the camera on. Then every chapter as a take: talk and click as in a presentation. The answers to questions that are a judgement as takes on a slide without a tab, camera on; the ones that show something as takes with talking and clicking.
3. **Process.** `just walkthrough prepare <take>` for every take: clean voice, corrected transcript, draft cuts. `just walkthrough check <take>` then says whether the take is usable: loudness, clipping, background noise, speaking pace and the actions in the log, each with a verdict. Run it right after a take, so a bad one is done again while everything is still set up.
4. **Scripts.** `just walkthrough script <take>` for every take whose chapters the generated voice will speak. It writes a script per slide in `corpus/demo/walkthrough/script/`: the sentences that were said, with a marker where each action began. Correct the sentences where needed; the markers stay.
5. **Compose.** In `walkthrough.yaml`: the opening as a `take:` segment (with its cuts), the chapters as `script:` segments, the questions with their segments and the moment they are offered, and slide texts that should read differently. Then `just walkthrough build`, `just walkthrough verify` (it replays every chapter in a headless browser in two window sizes and names each action it could not find; CI runs the same check on every change to the demo) and watch it with `just dev-demo` at `/rondleiding`.
6. **Publish.** `just walkthrough publish walkthrough-<date>` uploads the media to a GitHub release (it asks first; a release is public) and writes the tag into `timeline.json`. Commit `corpus/demo/walkthrough/`; the Docker build fetches the media from the release.

When the demo changes and a chapter no longer replays, record that chapter again (step 2 to 4 for one take) and point its `script:` segment at the new script. A text correction is a change to the script and a new build; only the changed lines are generated again.

## Running locally

```bash
just demo              # builds the WASM engine, starts Vite on :7400 and opens the browser
just dev-demo          # the same, without opening the browser
just demo-why          # the "why" backend on :7401, with your own Claude login; password "lokaal-demo-wachtwoord"
```

Vite forwards `/api/why` to `just demo-why`, so run the two side by side to try the explanation.

Checking, outside the browser:

```bash
just demo-check        # laws, Awb parity, service map, scenarios, frontend tests, WASM and build
just bdd-demo          # the scenarios only (plus the Awb lifecycle test)
just validate-demo     # the laws only (schema and type check)
```
