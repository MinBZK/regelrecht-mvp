---

A cell is an organization that records each legal fact it establishes as a dated entry, a chronolexogram, in its own chronicle (*kroniek*). The cell answers later questions from that chronicle. The vocabulary comes from the [Chronolexografie position paper](https://chronolexografie.nl/position-paper/) and [RFC-022](/rfcs/rfc-022).

This page shows how RegelRecht implements it. The design is in [RFC-046](/rfcs/rfc-046) and [RFC-048](/rfcs/rfc-048); what is still open is in [Open Points in Chronolexography](/concepts/chronolexography-open-points).

Recording is an optional layer ([RFC-046](/rfcs/rfc-046)). The procedure a cell plays is modeled in the law itself ([Applications, Decisions and Objections](/concepts/administrative-procedures)).

| Part | Role | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Cell | Keeps its chronicle; records and decides through the engine | `corpus/cells/<cell>/`, `packages/cel` |
| Reduction | Gives a named answer from the chronicle | `corpus/regulation/nl/reducties/` |
| Policy | Binds an open term of the law to a cell's answer | `corpus/regulation/nl/uitvoeringsbeleid/` |
| Engine | Executes the law, asks the cells, combines their answers. Stores nothing | `packages/engine` |

## A cell

A cell is a directory with `cel.yaml`. `Cell::open` opens it with its chronicle on file, `Cell::in_memory` with an empty chronicle.

```yaml
# corpus/cells/<cell>/cel.yaml
name: Het college van burgemeester en wethouders van Voorbeeldstad
category: college van burgemeester en wethouders
answers:
  eerder_vergunning_verleend: reductie_eerder_vergunning_verleend
```

The law names a role ([Competent Authority](/concepts/competent-authority)). The engine matches an `INSTANCE` to `name` and a `CATEGORY` to `category`. `answers` is the cell's catalogue: which answers it gives, and from which reduction. It holds no logic, and nothing else about a cell is configured.

## What a chronicle holds

| Kind | Recorded by | Fields come from |
|---|---|---|
| Submission (`AANVRAAG`, `BEZWAAR`, `BEROEP`) | `Cell::record_submission` | The article's submission item and the hooks on it |
| Decision (`BESCHIKKING`, `UITSPRAAK`) | `Cell::decide`, `Cell::decide_after` | The deciding article's inputs, findings included |
| Executogram (`EXECUTOGRAM`) | `Cell::record_executogram` | A fact an article `requires` ([RFC-051](/rfcs/rfc-051)) |

```json
{
  "id": "019a1b2d-…",
  "kind": "BESCHIKKING",
  "grondslag": "wet_voorbeeld#3",
  "recording_actor": "gemeente_voorbeeldstad",
  "recorded_on": "2026-10-20",
  "refers_to": "019a1b2c-…",
  "fields": { "bsn_aanvrager": "999993653", "medische_beoordeling": true },
  "outputs": { "vergunning_verleend": true, "bezwaartermijn_einddatum": "2026-12-01" }
}
```

A chronolexogram repeats nothing the law says. The law in force on `recorded_on` gives each field's sources and basis; a replay shows which fields held a finding. The chronicle is append-only, in date order.

## Recording and deciding

- `Cell::record_submission` runs the establishing article at the stage named after the submission's kind, so the hooks on it run. A missing required field goes under `missing`: an incomplete application is still one (Awb 4:5). The moment the law counts from is the day of recording. A submission may refer to a decision (`refers_to`), as an objection does.
- `Cell::decide` takes the id of a submission in the chronicle that requests this decision, and runs the later stages. Findings travel apart from the parameters. Each non-null output of type `decision`, such as a new decision on objection, becomes its own chronolexogram in the same append.
- `Cell::record_executogram` records a fact whole or not at all. The fact refers to nothing. A change is a new executogram; the old one stays.

The cell's code names no article of any law; everything it checks comes from the law. It refuses:

- any field the law does not give, and a wrong type;
- a `moment` supplied by the submitter;
- a decision on an id that is not a submission requesting it, a second decision on one submission, and replacing a decision twice;
- in a decision, a value from the caller that comes from elsewhere, and a finding of the wrong type on a term of the deciding article;
- a fact the article does not require, or under an article not in force that day;
- a fact with a field named `id` (rows use `id` for the executogram itself);
- a fact whose `competent_authority` does not name the cell.

The engine refuses a finding that no article in the decision asks for, or one of the wrong type.

A decision output of another legal character than the deciding article's own stays a value of the decision: a judgment can hold the decision the court sets in the place of the annulled one, and the court's cell does not record it as a decision of its own.

## Answering from the chronicle

A reduction gives a named answer from what the cell recorded earlier, such as "was this permit granted before?". It is the only rulework that reads a chronicle.

```yaml
# corpus/regulation/nl/reducties/reductie_eerder_vergunning_verleend/<valid_from>.yaml
regulatory_layer: REDUCTIE
competent_authority:
  name: Het college van burgemeester en wethouders van Voorbeeldstad
execution:                         # shortened
  parameters: [bsn_aanvrager]
  input:
    - name: besluiten
      type: array
      source:
        decisions: wet_voorbeeld#3      # one row per decision under art. 3
  output:
    - name: eerder_vergunning_verleend
```

The law does not ask the cell. The policy of the authority that decides binds the open term to the answer:

```yaml
# beleid_vergunningen_voorbeeldstad, art. 1 (UITVOERINGSBELEID)
implements:
  - {law: wet_voorbeeld, article: '3', open_term: eerder_vergunning_verleend}
execution:
  input:
    - name: antwoord
      nullable: true
      source:
        reduction: eerder_vergunning_verleend
        parameters: {bsn_aanvrager: $bsn_aanvrager}
```

- How a cell reduces is up to the cell; the engine only asks it for an answer by name. The cell in `packages/cel` uses what the engine offers: rulework of its own kind (`REDUCTIE`) in the corpus, under the holder it names. It reads decisions (`source.decisions`) or facts (`source.facts`), and may call policy for a norm.
- Wherever the binding runs, the engine asks the cell, which runs the reduction its catalogue names. The binding is policy, so the answer sets a finding aside ([order of precedence](/concepts/inversion-of-control#policy-that-fills-an-open-term-with-a-cells-answer)). Null on a term with a default or `decided_per_case_by` is silence, and the term falls back; on any other term null is the value.
- The loader refuses `source.decisions` and `source.facts` outside a `REDUCTIE`, and `source.reduction` outside such a binding.

## Documents between cells

Each actor keeps its own chronicle, and the law sends documents between them: the copy of the contested decision with the beroepschrift (Awb 6:5 lid 2), and the copy of the judgment to the parties (Awb 8:79 lid 1). A cell takes in another cell's document as a copy, never by reading that cell's chronicle.

- `Cell::afschrift` makes a copy of one of the cell's own decisions: the chronolexogram, its decision value from a replay in that cell, and `about`, what the submission it was taken on had received. Where a field of type `decision` holds an id, the copy holds that decision's value instead, nested the same way. Only the cell that took the decision makes a copy.
- `record_submission` with `Reference::Received(&copy)` records a submission on a decision of another cell. The chronolexogram holds `received: {from, id}` instead of `refers_to`, and its field of type `decision` holds the decision value itself, because this cell cannot replay it.
- `Cell::record_receipt` records that the cell received a copy, as an executogram of the fact the law requires for it. The receipt is the one executogram that refers to a decision: the cell's own decision that the copy concerns.
- `Cell::decide_after` decides on a submission again after a later chronolexogram that refers to the last decision on it, such as a receipt. The new decision holds that chronolexogram as `after`. The rule names no article; whether the earlier decision still counts is for whoever reads the chronicle.

The cell refuses a copy of what is no decision, a copy of its own decision offered back to it, a receipt for a decision the copy does not concern or dated before it, and a decision taken again without such a later chronolexogram. Opening a chronicle checks `after` and every receipt the same way. A reduction reads the receipts as it reads any recorded fact; the row of a receipt also gives the decision it concerns, under `refers_to`. [RFC-053](/rfcs/rfc-053) gives the design, for the appeal to the administrative court.

## Answers of other cells

A decision may take other cells along: its sphere. When a binding fills an open term with `competent_authority`, the engine asks every competent cell of the call, the deciding cell and its sphere, for the answer and merges their answers with the term's `combine`, or else the binding's ([Competent Authority](/concepts/competent-authority#who-answers-an-open-term)). A cell without that answer in its catalogue is silent. Without competence on the term, the engine asks the cell of the policy's holder. This is the paper's synthesis. It happens in the asking process, and each cell reduces only its own chronicle.

## Explaining a decision

The cell stores no reasons. It replays.

- `Cell::explain` retakes the decision on its own day, with the law and chronicle of that moment. It fails if the outcome differs.
- `Cell::findings` reads from the replay which findings counted.
- `Cell::explain_answer` reruns a reduction to show its reasoning. In the decision's trace the answer is one step.
