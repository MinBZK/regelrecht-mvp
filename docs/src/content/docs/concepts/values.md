description: "What a rulework computes with: types and units, explicit rounding, and the difference between an absent and an unknown value."

Every parameter, input, output and definition in a rulework has a type. A law also says what an amount is counted in and when to round it, and the engine holds a rulework to both. This page covers the values themselves. [Law Format](/concepts/law-format) shows where they sit in an article, and [Temporal Validity and Dates](/concepts/temporal-and-dates) covers dates.

## Types

A field's `type` is one of `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `amount`, `date`, `array`, `object` and `decision`. An `amount` is a quantity whose unit is declared next to it (below). A `decision` is the value of a decision another article took, with its fields, findings and outputs ([Cross-Law References](/concepts/cross-law-references#calling-the-decision-of-an-article)). An open term takes the narrower set `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `amount` and `date`.

Inside the engine a value is a boolean, an integer, an exact decimal, a string, a list or an object (`Value` in `packages/law-model/src/value.rs`). A date travels as a string and an amount as a number. Arithmetic is decimal, never floating point, so 0.1 plus 0.2 is 0.3 and a value changes only where the law says to round. A decimal holds 28 significant digits, and an operation that would overflow fails instead of losing precision.

A type is checked before the law runs. `just validate` and every load of a rulework run the type checker of [RFC-037](/rfcs/rfc-037): arithmetic and ordering on numbers, logic on booleans, no equality test between two different known types, and a literal output that matches its declared type. A field whose type the checker cannot know is left alone.

## Amounts and units

`type_spec.unit` says what an amount is counted in: `euro`, `eurocent`, `ratio`, `percentage`, `years`, `months`, `weeks` or `days`. A law mixes euros, eurocent, fractions, percentages and durations, and adding a number of days to an amount of money is a mistake a type system can catch ([RFC-023](/rfcs/rfc-023)).

```yaml
definitions:
  vermogensgrens_verzekerde:
    value: 14189600
    type: amount
    type_spec:
      unit: eurocent
```

A unit is a label and never changes a value. A `percentage` is not divided by 100 behind the scenes; a `… / 100` is an explicit operation where the value is applied. `ratio` (0 to 1) and `percentage` (0 to 100) are separate labels for the same dimension, so that a law saying "1,896" and a law saying "30 procent" are each transcribed as written.

The engine uses the labels to refuse a combination that makes no sense. Adding or comparing needs the same unit, so `eurocent` plus `days` fails and so does `euro` plus `eurocent`. A `ratio` or `percentage` times an amount keeps the amount's unit, and dividing two amounts of one unit gives a `ratio`. `just validate` checks this statically, and the engine checks it again at run time (`packages/engine/src/units.rs`). The static pass reads only `value:` expressions, so an action written as a bare `operation` is caught at run time only.

Units are opt-in per law. A value without a unit is never checked, so a rulework is unaffected until someone annotates it. Once it declares a unit anywhere, `just validate` also warns about an `amount` output without one.

`type_spec` also takes `precision`, `min` and `max`. The engine reads them and does not enforce them: `precision` rounds nothing, and a value outside `min` or `max` passes. Bounds are tracked in [issue #444](https://github.com/NederlandseDigitaleDienst/regelrecht/issues/444).

## Rounding

The engine never rounds on its own, not even money. Intermediate values keep full precision, and a value is rounded only where the law says so, with an operation ([RFC-024](/rfcs/rfc-024)):

| Operation | Direction | Dutch |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `ROUND` | nearest, ties away from zero | *rekenkundig afronden* |
| `CEIL` | up, toward +∞ | *naar boven afronden* |
| `FLOOR` | down, toward −∞ | *naar beneden afronden* |

Ties go away from zero because the Hoge Raad applies that where a law says "afronden" without a direction. Each operation takes one `value` and a `precision` in the value's own unit: `0` rounds to whole units, and `-2` rounds an amount in eurocent to whole euros.

```yaml
- output: tegemoetkoming
  value:
    operation: ROUND
    precision: 0
    value:
      operation: SUBTRACT
      values:
        - $normbedrag
        - $eigen_bijdrage
```

There is no banker's rounding, and no truncation toward zero for negative values; the RFC defers both until a law needs them. Cutting a date back to the first of its month is a date operation, not rounding ([Temporal Validity and Dates](/concepts/temporal-and-dates)). The operand rules are under [Rounding](/reference/schema#rounding) in the schema reference.

One place still loses digits. The plain JSON form of a result writes a decimal as a floating-point number; the stored form keeps every digit ([Law Model](/components/law-model)).

## Absent and unknown values

A register does not hold a value for everyone, and the engine keeps two cases apart ([RFC-036](/rfcs/rfc-036)).

An **absent** value, `null`, is a fact: the register says there is none, such as no partner or no rent. A field may hold it only when its declaration says `nullable: true`. A law tests it with `EQUALS … null` and may branch on it. Calculating, ordering or deciding on it is an error, because a legal text never treats "geen" as an amount or a verdict without saying so. An `IF` without a matching case or `default` also yields `null`, and so does `MIN` or `MAX` over an empty list.

An **unknown** value is a fact nobody has yet: a `source: {}` input no data source could supply, or an optional parameter the caller did not pass. A law cannot write one. It travels through every operation with the names of the missing facts, so a portal can ask for them. `AND` is false as soon as one operand is false, and `OR` true as soon as one is true, whatever the others are; otherwise the result is unknown. An unknown condition in an `IF` makes the whole `IF` unknown.

The type checker enforces the contract before the law runs. A `null` test on a field that is not nullable, a nullable value reaching a sum without a test for absence, or an `IF` without `default` on an output that is not nullable is refused. So is a nullable output from another law feeding an input that is not. The engine evaluates operands left to right, so a guard has to come first: `AND` of a false test and an absent value is false, while the same two in the other order is an error.

In a scenario's data table an empty cell is unknown and the word `null` is absence. The assertions read `is absent`, `is unknown`, and `is unknown for lack of "huur"`. This is the reverse of SQL, where `null` stands for the unknown; RFC-036 explains why the literal was kept for absence. The editor shows an unknown output as *onbekend* with the facts it lacks, an absent one as *geen*, and an output that was never computed as *niet berekend*.

[Collections](/concepts/collections#when-the-answer-is-not-known) covers an unknown inside a `FOREACH`.

## Callable and presentable

Every output is callable: another law can ask for it by name, which is what [cross-law references](/concepts/cross-law-references) rest on. Not every output is something to show a citizen. The Penitentiaire beginselenwet runs for nearly everyone the zorgtoeslag is computed for, and still has no place on a portal.

What a portal offers follows from the law ([RFC-038](/rfcs/rfc-038)). An article is an entry point when it produces a `BESCHIKKING`, a decision someone can contest, or a `RECHTSPOSITIE`, a position that arises by operation of law, such as the right to vote. An article that establishes a fact for other laws carries `INFORMATIEF` or no `produces` at all. The [glossary](/reference/glossary#legal-character) defines each legal character. The demo derives its portals from this (`frontend-demo/src/data/entrypoints.ts`), and from the key a law computes on whether the portal is for a citizen (`bsn`) or a business (`kvk_nummer`, `loonheffingennummer`). The engine is not involved.
